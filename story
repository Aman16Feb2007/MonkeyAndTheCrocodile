Once upon a time in a forest there lived a monkey who risided on a jamun tree,
which was on the banks of the river.
In the same forest there lived a crocodine and his wife.
On day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocolile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them.
As days paseded by the monkey and the crocodile became good friends.
